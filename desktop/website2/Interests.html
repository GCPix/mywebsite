      <p> Pixie decided she had done enough actual work, she needs her 20 hours sleep so I guess I will take over from here.
        Well there are a few things I like doing.  Heres an idea of what is further down.</p>

        <h2 id="a">Music</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy a lot of different things but to be honest have little time for most of them now.
          I have played a few different musical instruments but the main one was the accordion.
          An accordion is:
        </p>
            <blockquote> a musical instrument played by stretching and squeezing with the hands
            to work a central bellows that blows air over metal reeds, the melody and chords being
            sounded by buttons or keys.</blockquote>
          <p> I would also add that the standard adult one is heavy so,
          in case anyone was wondering, no I do not play standing up.  I also don't play Scottish
          (unless someone makes me).
          I have competed since I was about 8 and reached semi-professional level but it takes a
          huge commitment to continue at that level including competing around the world and simply
          rehearsal time so I hung up my hat afte the Virtuoso.

          I didn't stop playing, just not at that level.

          I was part of a music school in Paisley, taught by
          <a class="inline_link" target=_blank href="http://www.accordions.com/grahamlaurie/">Graham Laurie</a> and
          part of his orchestra.

          With the Orchestra we competed and travelled around Europe and Canada.
          If you want a look at the type of music we played, check out these YouTube clips:

        <h2>Books </h3>
        <p>music isn't the only thing I enjoy.  I am a total bookwork.  I have every electronic
        app for books but I also have a decent collection at home, sometimes multiple copies,
        well I need something to read in the bath.

        If one of the projects on this course is to create a library I have the perfect source
        material sitting in my living room, hall and both bedrooms.

        I have books from Mystery, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Classics, Historical Fiction and I could go on.....
        but I won't, suffice to say I like books.

      <h2>Walking/Visiting places</h3>
      <p>I originally had these as two seperate things but mostly I walk to see the scenery. I am
        not doing it for the exercise!
        When I go somewhere new, that isn't a city, I love to get out and see what they have.
        Hills, trees, water it doesn't really matter.  I can't stand too many people around me.
        I avoid Glasgow on a Saturday, Edinburgh is a no go during the festival unless I am in Portobello.
        I have been really lucky with work to travel all around Scotland and see some of the best bits from
        the Borders to the Western and Northern Isles.
        Here are a few of the pictures I have taken during that time.
