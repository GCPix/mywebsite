<p> I have had a catnap and am back to help.  I am not going to leave her to talk about me.
  She might tell you lies like, I pretend I am going to be sick to get attention or I refuse
  to eat my dinner if I haven't seen it put down in front of me.</p>

<p>I was born in July 2010 in Hillington, when they took me from my cat mother I was taken to the humans
  grans house while human mum worked away for a week. Eventually I went to my real home where I set about
  to ensure everyone understood who was in charge and who was the servants.<p>

    style="width:200px; height:250px; margin-right:15px;">
<p>I like to make sure the household chores are complete so I tend to supervise while beds are
  changed, rooms cleaned and more particularly while ironing is being done, although I will
  leave them to it as soon as they clean my floors with the noisy contraption. </p>

  <p>Once my house is clean I like to sit on the sofa, human 1 keeps puttng these soft things on my
    seat but I just ignore them and sit on her blanket.  Human 2 understands his place, he ensures
    I am comfortable</p>
