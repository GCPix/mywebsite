            Hello I am Pixie</p>
            <p>Probably not who you were expecting but the
            human said she needed help and I have agreed in exchange for treats and pets on demand.
            I am sure you would rather read more about me but I am told she should show first.
            If you want to know more about my life click on my picture to see my own page.

      <div>
        <p> The human in question calls herself Gillian.  She has been my servant for 8 years since
        they ripped me from my mother.
        I should say my main servant, there are two others in my kingdom but they don't seem to do a lot </p>

      <div>
        <p class="inline"><img src="./gill1.png" alt="a picture of Gillian Campbell"
        style="width:200px; height:250px; margin-right:15px;">
        So this is her. I didn't know her when this was taken, she must be really quite old as she
          said this was 20 years ago!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <p>Gillian has worked for a number of years as a trainer, she can't be very good at it she
            was never able to train me but apparently other humans thnk she is competent</p>

          <p> Before becoming a trainer she was a Chemical Engineer, working in the food industry.
              She worked for a company called Campbell's Grocery Products (no family relation)
              where she ran a pilot plant and ran 'Thermal Processing checks' which was just a technical way
              of saying she made sure food was safe to eat.  Apparently the food wasn't fit for me to eat
              but she claims it was quite nice for humans.</p>

            <p> Gillian has had a few hobbies over the year, annoyingly taking her away from giving me attention.
                You can see some more on this in the Interests page</p>
